    <h1>Guide to RoB 2.0: Risk of Bias Tool for RCTs</h1>

    <div id="main">
      <p>
        The RoB 2.0 tool assesses the risk of bias in randomized controlled
        trials (RCTs) based on five specific domains. A judgment (Low, Some
        Concerns, High) is made for each domain, leading to an overall judgment.

      <h2>The Five Domains of RoB 2.0</h2>
      <div class="rob2-domain">
        <h3>Domain 1: Bias arising from the randomization process</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Question:</strong> Is the assignment to intervention groups
          random and concealed?
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Focus:</strong> Was the sequence generation truly random, and
          was allocation concealment adequate?
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="rob2-domain">
        <h3>Domain 2: Bias due to deviations from intended interventions</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Question:</strong> Were participants and personnel blinded,
          and was the intervention administered as intended?
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Focus:</strong> Were there differences in care received
          between groups other than the intervention itself? Was blinding
          successful?
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="rob2-domain">
        <h3>Domain 3: Bias due to missing outcome data</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Question:</strong> Is the outcome data complete for all
          randomized participants?
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Focus:</strong> Was the amount and nature of missing data
          similar across groups? Was the missing data appropriately addressed
          (e.g., intention-to-treat analysis)?
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="rob2-domain">
        <h3>Domain 4: Bias in measurement of the outcome</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Question:</strong> Was the outcome assessment biased due to
          knowledge of the intervention received?
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Focus:</strong> Was the outcome measured in the same way for
          all groups? Were the outcome assessors blinded?
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="rob2-domain">
        <h3>Domain 5: Bias in selection of the reported result</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Question:</strong> Was the reported outcome selected based on
          the results?
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Focus:</strong> Did the study report pre-specified outcomes
          and analyses, or were there selective omissions based on statistical
          significance?
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Overall Risk of Bias Judgments</h2>
      <p>
        The overall judgment for the study is derived from the judgments across
        the five domains:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Low Risk of Bias:</strong> Low risk for all five domains.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Some Concerns:</strong> Some concerns in at least one domain,
          but not high risk.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>High Risk of Bias:</strong> High risk in at least one domain,
          or some concerns in multiple domains that raise serious doubts.
        </li>
      </ul>
